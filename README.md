# path-draw

A simple FRC path drawing utility for 2021

## Usage

Make sure you have Python 3.8 installed, then run the path_draw.py script.

You can modify which path it follows by using the add rotation or add straightaway methods of path. The defaults are the ones used by our FRC team this year.

To switch to a different map, you can change the start variable (x, y) to match your starting position in feet, and then specify a different map on the line below (see maps.py for available maps, at the top of the file).
